## University Chatbot Implementation


Welcome to our university chatbot project, a collaboration between Ahnaf, Aatheeshwaran, and Iman. This initiative was undertaken as part of our AI/ML course. The following sections provide a detailed overview of our project and the methodologies employed.

### 1. Dataset: The JSON File
- **Description**: The JSON file serves as the foundation of our project, the raw data that of our chatbot.
- **Note**: The current dataset is a prototype, collaboratively crafted with the assistance of ChatGPT. While it possesses general applicability for various educational institutions, our aim is to adapt this through transfer learning, tailoring it specifically for our university in the subsequent phases.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
We have ventured into two distinct preprocessing techniques to transform our raw data into a machine-understandable format. These methodologies are:
- **Tokenization**: This method involves segmenting text into individual tokens (usually words) and encoding them numerically.
- **CountVectorizer**: Converts text data into a matrix of word counts.

We cannot actually test the efficiency of the techniques as we are yet to build the machine learnign model. Additionally, we are open to exploring other advanced preprocessing methods, such as Word Embeddings, TF-IDF, One-Hot Encoding, BERT etc. to enhance our chatbot's performance.

### 3. Data Visualization
To obtain a clear perspective on our preprocessed data, we have employed visualization tools:
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for Python, offering diverse visual representations.
- **Pandas**: Specifically, the DataFrame structure, which facilitates data manipulation and analysis.
